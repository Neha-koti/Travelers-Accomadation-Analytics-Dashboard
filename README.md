# Travelers Accomadation Analytics Dashboard
 Project on Hotel bookings
In this project, a dataset comprising 119,390 hotel booking records from two distinct hotels was meticulously collected and processed. Using the Power BI tool, interactive and dynamic dashboards were artfully crafted, and crucial trends and patterns within the data were explored. This project empowers the hospitality industry with valuable insights for optimized booking management and improved customer experiences.

We need to use Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Microsoft PowerBI  for this project. We load the dataset into PowerBI and do data cleaning and data transformation. And then create interactive dashboards in PowerBI and retrieve meaningful insights. We can gain insights into booking trends, cancellations, and guest behaviour in the hotel industry.
